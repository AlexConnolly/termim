# termim
A terminal based instant-messaging client used as a sandbox project for learning new technologies.

## Why?
I hate instant messaging when working because:
- It's a context switch
- The UI is messy and intense
- I can use my keyboard to navigate, but it still feels so clunky

# What?
A terminal based instant-messaging client that can be ran inside your favourite IDE (or wherever) accompanied by a server you can run and customise yourself.

termim _will_ support
- Rooms
- Basic chat messages
- Command interface for administrators
- A UI controlled entirely by the keyboard
- The ability to stay in your IDE

termim will _not_ support
- Emojis
- Calls / Video
- Bright user interfaces
- Threads

In a world full of complexity and features, I need a messaging system that I can run locally, with friends, and colleagues, without having to switch tasks.
